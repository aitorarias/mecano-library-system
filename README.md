# Mecano Design System Library

This project is a design system library built in React, aimed at providing a consistent and efficient way to develop user interfaces. The design system library helps maintain a cohesive and polished look and feel across different applications and components. It is based on: https://www.figma.com/file/AqwNxkvGjC9XywYy8I5XuV/Mecano-Design-System-(beta)-(Community)?type=design&node-id=592-574&t=HirkIT56UNKBBFyR-0

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a reusable set of UI components, styles, and guidelines that can be easily integrated into various React applications. By adopting a design system, developers can save time and effort by leveraging pre-built components and standardized styles.

## Project Phase

The project is currently in progress and is at the 15% completion mark. During this phase, the following tasks have been accomplished:

## Initial project setup and configuration

- Research and identification of core design principles
- Creation of basic component structure
- Implementation of foundational styles and typography
- Key Features

Once completed, the design system library will offer the following key features:

- Reusable Components: A comprehensive set of reusable UI components, such as buttons, forms, navigation, and more, that can be easily customized and integrated into different applications.

- Consistent Styles: A consistent and unified visual style, including typography, color schemes, spacing, and responsive layouts, ensuring a coherent user experience throughout the applications.

- Accessibility: Accessibility considerations and best practices will be incorporated into the design system, ensuring that the components are usable and inclusive for all users.

- Documentation: Detailed documentation will accompany the design system library, providing clear guidelines on how to use the components, customize styles, and follow design principles.

- Easy Customization: The design system will be highly customizable, allowing developers to tailor the components and styles to suit their specific project requirements.
